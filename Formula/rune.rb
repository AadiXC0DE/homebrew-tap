# A formula rather than a cask, because this is a command line program: it has no
# application bundle to copy, and Homebrew installs a formula's binary onto the
# path where a shell finds it.
#
# `rune` is already the name of an embeddable language in homebrew/core, and core
# wins a bare name, so this is installed as `aadixc0de/tap/rune`. A bare
# `brew install rune` would get the language, which is why the readme gives the
# qualified name.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Rune has no default provider. Connect one before the first turn:

        rune connect

      That lists the providers and asks for what the one you choose needs.

      Then check what this machine supports:

        rune doctor
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/rune --version")
  end
end
