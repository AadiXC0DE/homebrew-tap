  caveats <<~EOS
    Graphe is signed, but not notarized by Apple: there is no paid developer
    account yet. Homebrew 5 and earlier installed it with no prompt, but
    Homebrew 6 applies the quarantine attribute to cask installs, so on first
    launch macOS may ask you to allow it. If it does: right-click the app in
    Finder and choose Open, or use "Open Anyway" in System Settings, Privacy
    & Security. It is the genuine binary from the GitHub release, not a broken
    download. The prompt exists because Apple has not vetted a signed binary
    from a free account, and notarization removes it for good.
