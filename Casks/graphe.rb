  # does remove it. Deliberately *not* listed: `~/.pi`, which holds the account
  # the user connected and belongs to Pi rather than to us, and no project
  # folder anywhere — those are the user's own work and nothing we install may
  # ever remove them.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Graphe is signed, but not notarized by Apple — there is no paid developer
    account yet. Homebrew 5 and earlier installed it with no prompt, but
    Homebrew 6 applies the quarantine attribute to cask installs, so on first
    launch macOS may ask you to allow it. If it does: right-click the app in
    Finder and choose Open, or use "Open Anyway" in System Settings → Privacy
    & Security. It is the genuine binary from the GitHub release, not a broken
    download — the prompt exists because Apple has not vetted a signed binary
    from a free account. Notarization removes it for good.
